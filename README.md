# Credit-Risk
The dataset includes some demographics and recent financial data (the past six months) for a sample of 30,000 account holders. This data is at the credit account level; in other words, there is one row for each account. Rows are labeled by whether in the next month after the six month historical data period, an account owner has defaulted, or in other words, failed to make the minimum payment.

The goal is to analyze the data for whether an account will default next month, given demographics and historical data.

The dataset used is a modified version of this dataset in the UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients
